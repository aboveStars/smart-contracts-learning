 # IPFS-URI-PULLING-TEST
* This small UNIT's purpose in this repo, checks if we can send a image to [IPFS Network](https://ipfs.tech) and pull the *URI* (an IPFS Link for our image on IPFS) of this image.
    
    * **After** pulling `Image URI` successfuly *(main purpose of this UNIT)*, we can send our` NFT's metadata` to [IPFS Network](https://ipfs.tech), and can see our NFT on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).


* **This is just one part of IPFS Work we have to do. If you want to send your NFT to OpeanSea totally, you should also send your metadata to IPFS Network.** 

## If you want to send your NFT totally, my roadmap was like this:

* Send Image to [IPFS Network](https://ipfs.tech) -> Pull the *URI* of image --> Put *this URI* to `metadata` -> Send this `metadata` to IPFS -> Pull this `metadata`'s *URI* --> *Mine or send* to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
