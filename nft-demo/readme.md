# NFT-DEMO
* In this unit, we have made **NFT**.
    * This NFT are stored in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).
    * We made a **basic** and an **advanced** version.
        * In *basic* verison, we **don't** need to create any *`URI`* , we just needed to `mint` and `send` the NFT to the [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), with our `SimpleCollectible` **smart-contract**
            * *`URI`*'s is provided by **someone else**.


        * In *advanced* version, we had to send our *`NFT's image and NFT's metadata`* *we had to create* to [IPFS Network](https://ipfs.tech/) and **pull** their *`URI`*. Then `mint` and `send` to the [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) via our `AdvancedCollectible` **smart-contract** by using *`generated URI`*'s.
            * *`URI`*'s is generated by **ourselves**.
